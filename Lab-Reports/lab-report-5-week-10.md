*Lab report entailing difference between own code and code given by professor*<br>

**How different testers are found**
1. Opened the **test-files** folder
2. Manually and randomly looked through the tests and checking what each test tested.
3. Found  two tests:<br>
      * 194.md<br>![194.md](../Photos/LR5/194-raw.png) 
      * 324.md<br>![324.md](../Photos/LR5/342-raw.png)
      <br>
4. Copied the two tests into own repository, and ran to get results

**Test 194.md**<br>
* *Own Code Test results*<br>![Own194](../Photos/LR5/Own-Code-194.png)
* *Class Code Test results*<br>![MD194](../Photos/LR5/MD-194.png)
* *Expected output based on preview*<br>![Expected194](../Photos/LR5/194-Expected.png)

* Neither outputs are correct based on the preview as the expected output should be `[title(with parens)]`

* *To Fix*
